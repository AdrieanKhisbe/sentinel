> A [Seneca](http://senecajs.org) testing toolkit


# Goals

* Very simple to use and configure test application.
* Configure and forget - after test suites and alarms are configured there is no need to check the Sentinel's UI for data - user will receive notifications for internal events.
* Validate the external API of a Seneca system - i.e. the HTTP urls etc.
* Is able to retrieve the HTTP API description from seneca-web from target application.
* Provides a separate plugin that runs inside the target application for reporting internal data/events.
* Easy to configure test suites - including dynamic and chained test suites.
* Send notifications for configured events.
* Automatically creates API documentation for monitored web application.
